                Hello, I am Mustafa, AI did not write this, this is not some generic text I put here to fill this section, I want to take this time to welcome you to my website and Portfolio I took months creating, and most importantly I want to thank you for taking the time
                to know me by reading the about me section I created as part of my portfolio.
                <br>
                I built websites in the past but this one in particular I am proud of, as I dove into hours of research hosting this for the world
                to see without paying more than I needed, and I am proud of the work I put into this website.   
            </p>
            <p class="p4">
                I started as a tester, manual tester to be exact. I stepped into the world of consulting along with testing 
                and I learned alot although this was not what I wanted to do for the rest of my life.
                I have testing certificates such as the ISTQB AI Testing, ISTQB Foundations and the Agile Tester Certificate.
                But I started to learn more about the cloud and I can proudly say I hold cloud certificates in 
                AWS, Azure, Google, IBM, and Oracle. 
            </p>
            <p class="p4">
                I am knowleageable in cloud, Testing, GenAI, and IT support as my most recent completion was the google IT support professional
                certificate from coursera. I am showcasing these certifcates not because I want you to see my list, but to understand
                I am a continous learner, I love learnign and I do believe knowledge is power, and with this knowledge 
                I will acheieve success in my future roles. I want to learn something new everday, I mean no one 
                else can learn for you right?
            </p>
            <p class="p4">
                I have certificates in AI also, in this day an age I beleive every person in tech should have some. it is 
                a path of continous learning and an ever expanding field. I myslef studied Computer science so I understand 
                the "ever expanding" world of tech very well. with multiple promotions from my current job, I am proud of where 
                I am today, and I am looking forward to where I will be in the future.
            </p>
